 * gradients, transforms, groups or text. That is the whole of what an icon needs: every vector editor
 * exports artwork as filled paths, and the rest of SVG is a document format we are not implementing.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Flattened, not kept as curves</h3>
 *
 * <p>This produces points. Keeping the curves would matter for a distance-field bake, where segment type
 * is the input msdfgen wants — see {@code ICONS.md}. For getting a shape on screen through
 * {@code ctx.curve()}, which strokes straight segments, points are the useful form and flattening here
 * means the consumer needs no curve maths at all.</p>
 *
 * <p>Fixed subdivision rather than adaptive: an icon is a few dozen segments and the difference is
 * invisible. Adaptive flattening is worth it when the curve count is unbounded, which is exactly the case
 * this is not.</p>
