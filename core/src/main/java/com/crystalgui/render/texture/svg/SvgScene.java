/**
 * A <b>resolved</b> SVG document: the picture, with every question about SVG already answered.
 *
 * <h3>What "resolved" means, and why it is the whole point</h3>
 *
 * <p>Ported from <b>usvg</b> (Apache-2.0/MIT), the resolution half of the {@code resvg} project. usvg's
 * one idea is that SVG-the-format and SVG-the-picture are different problems, and that a renderer should
 * never see the first. It parses a file and hands back a tree in which:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>every shape is a <b>path</b> — {@code rect}, {@code circle}, {@code polygon} and friends are gone;</li>
 *   <li>every coordinate is <b>absolute</b> — group transforms are flattened into the points themselves,
 *       so there is no transform left to apply;</li>
 *   <li>every style is <b>concrete</b> — inheritance, {@code style=""}, presentation attributes and
 *       {@code currentColor} have been collapsed into one fill and one stroke;</li>
 *   <li>{@code use}, {@code symbol} and {@code defs} have been <b>expanded</b>, so nothing refers to
 *       anything;</li>
 *   <li>paint servers are resolved to <b>user space</b> — an {@code objectBoundingBox} gradient has had
 *       its box folded in and is stated in the same coordinates as the path it paints.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The payoff is that everything downstream — tessellation, gradient banding, submission — reads a
 * scene and never a document. {@link SvgTessellator} takes contours and paint and has no idea SVG exists;
 * it could tessellate a font glyph unchanged. That separation is what usvg exists to provide and it is
 * the reason it is worth porting rather than inventing.</p>
 *
 * <h3>The one thing NOT flattened, deliberately</h3>
 *
 * <p>A gradient keeps a {@link Gradient#transform() transform} instead of having it folded into the ramp,
 * and usvg keeps {@code gradientTransform} for the same reason: a gradient is not a set of points, so a
 * transform cannot be applied "to it" the way one is applied to a contour. Under a skew or a non-uniform
 * scale a radial gradient stops being radial, and the only faithful representation of that is the matrix
 * itself. Folding it is correct for the common case and silently wrong for the interesting one.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Paint order is list order</h3>
 *
 * <p>SVG paints in document order with no z-index, so this is a flat list rather than a tree: the group
 * structure has served its purpose (inheritance and transforms) by the time a scene exists, and keeping
 * it would mean every consumer re-walking a hierarchy to recover an order that is already known.</p>
 *
 * @see SvgResolver the walk that produces one
 * @see SvgTessellator the consumer that turns one into triangles
