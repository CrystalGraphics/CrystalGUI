/**
 * A linear or radial paint server, evaluated per point.
 *
 * <h3>Why one colour was not enough</h3>
 *
 * <p>The first pass collapsed every gradient to its midpoint stop. That is defensible for a two-stop
 * gradient and badly wrong for real artwork, because of one detail: {@code gradientUnits="userSpaceOnUse"}
 * states the axis in the <b>document's</b> coordinates, not the shape's, and an exported logo routinely
 * gives a shape an axis several times its own size. The shape then occupies a narrow slice of the ramp —
 * so its actual colours have nothing to do with the ramp's middle.</p>
 *
 * <p>The JetBrains mark is the case in point. Its four gradients all run orange-or-pink to blue over axes
 * up to 87 units long inside a 70-unit box, and every one of them has a deliberately desaturated stop near
 * {@code 0.5} to make that blend read smoothly. Sampling the middle picks exactly those stops: the whole
 * logo comes out brown and purple, which is a plausible-looking picture of the wrong thing.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Evaluated on the CPU, per triangle</h3>
 *
 * <p>{@code CgVectorRenderer.Triangle} takes one flat colour, so the gradient is realised by subdivision —
 * the fill is cut fine enough along the gradient's own direction that a flat colour per triangle is
 * indistinguishable from a ramp. That costs triangles and no shader work at all, which is the right trade
 * at icon sizes: a paint-server material would mean a second shader, a second bind, and a per-shape uniform
 * upload, to remove banding nobody can see.</p>
 *
 * <p>Cutting along the gradient's <em>direction</em> rather than uniformly is what keeps the count sane. A
 * horizontal gradient needs no horizontal cuts at all, so its shape stays at a handful of bands however
 * tall it is.</p>
