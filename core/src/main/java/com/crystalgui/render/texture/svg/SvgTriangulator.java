/**
 * Turns a set of closed contours into triangles, so a filled shape can be drawn.
 *
 * <h3>Trapezoid decomposition, not ear clipping</h3>
 *
 * <p>Ear clipping is the textbook answer and it is the wrong one here. It triangulates a <b>single simple
 * polygon</b> — and real artwork is neither single nor simple. A logo is several contours at once, its
 * counters and windows are holes that have to be <em>subtracted</em>, and exported paths self-intersect
 * routinely. Ear clipping fills a hole solid, which turns a ring into a disc and an "O" into a blob.</p>
 *
 * <p>So: slice the shape into horizontal bands at every vertex {@code y}, and within each band find where
 * the edges cross, sort those crossings, and apply the fill rule to decide which spans are inside. Each
 * inside span becomes a trapezoid — two triangles.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>This is exact, not an approximation.</b> The tempting objection is that horizontal bands must
 * stair-step a diagonal edge. They do not, because the bands are cut at <em>every</em> vertex: no vertex
 * can then fall inside a band, so within one band every edge is a straight run with no bend, and the
 * trapezoid's slanted sides lie exactly on it. Cutting at arbitrary intervals instead is what produces
 * stair-steps, and is the version of this algorithm people remember.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Both fill rules, for free</h3>
 *
 * <p>Once the crossings in a band are sorted, {@code evenodd} is "every other span" and {@code nonzero}
 * is "spans where the accumulated winding is not zero". They differ only in that walk, so supporting SVG's
 * actual default ({@code nonzero}) costs nothing — and getting it wrong inverts every hole in a file
 * authored with overlapping contours.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Self-intersection is handled, and it had to be</h3>
 *
 * <p>A crossing point is not a vertex, so nothing cuts a band there by default — and the band containing it
 * has its left and right walls trade places partway down. The trapezoid built from them is a bowtie: it
 * covers a wedge the shape does not occupy and leaves a matching wedge bare. On stacked artwork that reads
 * as smears of whatever is <em>underneath</em>, which looks like a paint bug rather than a geometry one.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link Edges#selfIntersections} finds every crossing and adds its {@code y} to the band cuts, which is
 * all it takes: below the crossing the edges are in one order and above it the other, so no band ever
 * contains a swap. Not an edge case worth skipping — the JetBrains mark has four polygons that each fold
 * back over themselves.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Why both sweeps carry an active set — the cost that was actually being paid</h3>
 *
 * <p>Bands are cut at every vertex, so <b>a shape has about as many bands as edges</b>. The obvious way to
 * write either sweep is a nested loop — for each band, ask every edge whether it crosses; for each edge,
 * ask every other edge whether it meets it — and both are then quadratic in the vertex count. That is not a
 * pathological case, it is the normal one: a curve-heavy icon flattens to a few hundred edges and pays a
 * few hundred <em>squared</em>, which is where 54% of a document's load time was going.</p>
 *
 * <p>The fix is the same in both places and is the oldest trick in scanline rendering: an <b>active edge
 * table</b>. Sort the edges once by their top {@code y}; as the sweep descends, admit each edge when it
 * starts and retire it when it ends. Both boundaries are monotone in the sweep position, so every edge is
 * admitted once and retired once, and a band only ever touches the edges genuinely spanning it. That takes
 * the band sweep from {@code O(bands × edges)} to {@code O(n log n + crossings)} — and the crossing count
 * is the size of the output, so it cannot be beaten.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link Edges#selfIntersections} gets the same treatment with the same argument: two edges can only
 * meet where their {@code y} ranges <em>overlap</em>, so the pairs worth testing are exactly the pairs
 * simultaneously live in the sweep. A bounding-box reject on {@code x} sits inside that, because the
 * intersection maths costs two divides and a box test costs two comparisons.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Both prunes are exact, not heuristic</b>, and that distinction is the whole safety argument. An
 * intersection strictly interior to both edges lies at a single {@code y}, which must be strictly inside
 * both edges' {@code y} spans — so a pair whose spans do not overlap could not have contributed a crossing
 * to begin with, and skipping it changes nothing. The same holds for the box reject. This rewrite is
 * therefore a pure performance change: it emits <b>the same triangles, in the same order, bit for bit</b>,
 * which is the property to check first if it is ever suspected of a visual regression.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Flat arrays, and why they are not premature</h3>
 *
 * <p>Edges and output triangles are flat primitive arrays rather than {@code List<float[]>}. A moderately
 * complex icon reaches tens of thousands of triangles, and the list form costs a {@code float[6]}, a boxed
 * {@code Integer} and a boxed {@code Boolean} for each of them — allocation that outweighs the arithmetic
 * it accompanies. The parallel-array note on {@link #sortByX} already made this argument for the innermost
 * loop; this is the same argument applied to the two structures around it.</p>
 *
 * <h3>This class cannot profile itself</h3>
 *
 * <p><b>No {@code CgProfiler} scopes here, and that is a constraint rather than an oversight.</b> Filling is
 * pure geometry, so it is reachable from {@code headlessTest} — where CrystalGraphics <em>core</em> is
 * deliberately absent — and {@code CgProfiler} lives there. A scope in a method body resolves on first
 * execution, so adding one does not fail the build: it fails at run time with {@code NoClassDefFoundError},
 * and only in the source set that exists to catch exactly that. {@link SvgTessellator} is one level up, is
 * not headless-reachable, and already times the whole call as {@code svg.tessellate} — put the scope there.</p>

     * icon</b>. Dividing the budget by the bands that actually exist is the only place the product is
     * visible, which is why this lives here and not with the spacing that requested it.</p>
     *
     * <h3>Why 900, and why it is a ceiling rather than an answer</h3>
     *
     * <p>A mesh is built once and cached <em>scale-free</em>, so the number has to be chosen for the size

     * and the fragment already mixes them, but a fill forces {@code t = 0} and there is nowhere in the

         * case.</b> Exported logo artwork is full of them: the JetBrains mark has four polygons of seven and
         * eight points that each fold back over themselves. Without a cut at the crossing, one band contains
         * the swap — its left and right walls trade places partway down — and the trapezoid built from them
         * is a bowtie covering a wedge of space the shape does not occupy, while leaving a matching wedge
         * that it does bare. On a stack of overlapping polygons that reads as smears of the colour
         * <em>underneath</em> showing through, which looks like a paint bug rather than a geometry one.</p>
         *
         * <p>Cutting there is enough. Below the crossing the two edges are in one order and above it the
         * other; within each band they never swap, so the ordinary sweep is exact again. There is no need to
         * split the edges themselves or to know where the crossing is in {@code x} — the per-band midpoint
         * sort finds that on its own.</p>

         *
         * <p>An intersection strictly interior to both edges sits at one {@code y}, and each edge is
         * non-horizontal, so its parameter is monotone in {@code y} — the crossing's {@code y} therefore
         * lies strictly inside <em>both</em> spans. Two edges whose spans do not overlap cannot produce one.
         * Sweeping by {@code lo} and keeping an active set tests exactly the overlapping pairs and no
         * others, which is why this is a prune rather than an approximation.</p>
         *
         * <p>The lower-indexed edge is always taken as {@code a}. The intersection is symmetric in exact
         * arithmetic and not in floats, and the answer feeds a list that is deduplicated by
         * {@link #EPSILON} — so fixing the roles keeps the output identical to the naive {@code i < j}
         * order rather than merely equivalent to it.</p>
