     * <p>It used to, and the cost was not the regex — that was hoisted to a {@code Pattern} and it barely
     * moved. The cost is <b>allocation per coordinate</b>: {@code split} produces a {@code String} for
     * every number, and {@code SvgDocument.number} then calls {@code trim()} on it before
     * {@code Float.parseFloat}, so a polygon of forty points allocated a hundred and twenty objects to
     * read eighty floats.</p>
     *
     * <p>It showed. Measured over the shipped set, {@code polyline}/{@code polygon} elements cost
     * <b>7.2 µs each against 5.4 µs for actual {@code path} elements</b> — the shapes with no curves in
     * them were dearer than the ones made of nothing but curves. Reusing {@link SvgPath.Cursor} reads the
     * attribute in place with no intermediate strings at all, and its number parser is the same exact
     * integer fast path that {@code d} data already goes through.</p>
     *
     * <h3>One deliberate behaviour change</h3>
     *
     * <p>{@code split} treated {@code "1.5.2"} as a single malformed token and yielded {@code 0}; the
     * cursor reads it as {@code 1.5} then {@code .2}, because a second decimal point starts a new number.
     * <b>That is the SVG number grammar</b> — the same rule {@code d} data has always followed here — and
     * it is what minifiers rely on. No shipped icon exercises it, so the corpus is unchanged; where the
     * two differ, this is the correct one.</p>

     *
     * <p>Every segment is submitted as its own instance, so a joint between two of them is where the
     * stroke has to be made continuous. Giving both sides a round cap does that — and stacks two identical
     * half-discs on one point, so the antialiased rim composites twice ({@code 1-(1-a)²} rather than
     * {@code a}) and the joint reads as a bump on the edge. {@code stroke.glsl} documents that failure for
     * the engine's own curve splitter, which butts its interior ends for exactly this reason.</p>
     *
     * <p>Butting BOTH sides is not the answer either: with no join geometry, the outer side of every bend
     * loses a wedge, and a flattened curve is fifteen bends. <b>One round cap per joint is enough</b> — a
     * half-disc past an endpoint spans the full stroke width, so it fills the notch on its own for any
     * bend, and there is nothing to composite it against. So: butt the start of every segment that has a
     * predecessor, round the end of every segment that has a successor.</p>
     *
     * <p>That also retires a workaround. The draw used to force {@code CAP_ROUND} whenever the file asked
     * for {@code butt}, because per-segment butt caps notched every joint — which meant a stroke authored
     * with flat ends could not have them. The op's own cap now survives to the two ends that are really
     * ends.</p>
     *
     * <h3>Degenerate segments are dropped here</h3>
     *
     * <p>A round cap on a segment of no length paints a filled dot, so a path whose {@code z} closes onto
     * the point it already ended at would leave a speck at its start — and filtering per frame would pay
     * for that check on every draw of every icon forever. It is a property of the geometry, so it belongs
     * with it. Caps are assigned <b>after</b> the drop, so the first and last surviving segment of a
     * contour are the ones that get its real ends.</p>
