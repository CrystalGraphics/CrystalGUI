; MODIFICATIONS: the upstream files are split across an `; inherits:` chain that this engine does not
; implement -- there is no query-inheritance mechanism here, and adding one to read six files would be
; machinery for a feature nobody asked for. The chain is therefore RESOLVED AT VENDORING TIME by
; concatenating the inherited files ahead of the language's own, in inheritance order, which is exactly
; what nvim-treesitter's loader does at runtime. Nothing else is changed: no pattern is edited, removed
; or reordered. Where this engine needs a deviation it is applied at LOAD time, in Queries.java, so the
; deviation stays one reviewable table rather than a fork of somebody else's query.
